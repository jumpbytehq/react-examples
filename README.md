# Learning React
I am just staring out with React and all I can say is, stop whatever you are doing (if you can not then cancel the weekend movie) and learn React. It's not just great but an undoubtably awesome library. It will definitely change your fundamental thinking on how to develop a Web application.

# Where to start

[https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) - Don't skip the default documentation

Good compilation of lessions [https://egghead.io/courses/react-fundamentals](https://egghead.io/courses/react-fundamentals)

[Learn Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) - not because its popular, chances are you will need it pretty soon

# My Experience 

I have lot of catchup, but I will try to keep this place updated :).
